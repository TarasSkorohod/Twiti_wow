### Launching an application from the command line

To run the application from the command line, you need to have Maven installed. To check if maven is installed, run the mvn â€“version command on the command line.
```sh
mvn -version
```

If Maven is installed, to run the application, go to the root of the social-network-api project through the command line and run the command mvn spring-boot:run
```sh
cd  social-network-api
```
```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The CLI will run your application on the configured port and you can access it just like you would if you start the app in an IDE.
